/** This class is a simple image finder which returns all images
 *  that may have some overlap with the output image.
 *  Unlike the conventional image finders it does not return
 *  an integer array giving the image to sample for each output
 *  pixel.  A zero-element array is returned and is not expected
 *  to be used.  However in the input image array, any image
 *  where there is apparently no overlap between the input image
 *  and the output image is set to null.
 *  <p>
 *  This image finder should not be used with the standard mosaicker.
 *  It is anticipated to be used in mosaickers which will analyze
 *  each input image for overlap, presumably because they are going to
 *  add data from multiple images.
