  <Description>
   <![CDATA[
The INTEGRAL observatory (Winkler et al. 2003, A&amp;A, 411, L1) was 
launched in October 2002. The spectrograph SPI (Vedrenne et al. 2003,
A&amp;A, 411, L63) consists of 19 Germanium detectors and is capable of
imaging in the 20 - 8000 keV band because of a coded mask. Part of the
core program of the INTEGRAL mission is a study of the Galactic Centre,
the Galactic Centre Deep Exposure (GCDE).<p>
The SPI significance map  is based on the public GCDE data and
uses data in the 20 - 40 keV energy range. The analysis of the data was
done using the SPIROS software (Skinner &amp; Connell 2003, A&amp;A, 411, L123).
This software uses the 'Iterative Removal of Sources' technique in order 
to find the most significant sources. In the output significance map the
sources found in this process are put on top of the residual map as 
points with a FWHM of 1 degree.
<p>
Current data respresent the combination of all public observations as of 
September 1, 2004.
