   <![CDATA[
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is the deepest large scale survey of the 
sky currently available.  SkyView dynamically queries the SDSS archive
to retrieve information and resample it into the user
requested frame.  Further information on the SDSS and many additional services
are available at the <a href=http://www.sdss.org> SDSS Web site</a>.
