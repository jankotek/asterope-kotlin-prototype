  <Description>
   <![CDATA[
These maps present maps of 
ROSAT soft X-ray all-sky survey as presented in Snowden et al, ApJ 485, 125 (1997).
The maps cover approximately 98% of the sky.  These maps have had all point sources
removed
These surveys supercede the RASS0.25, RASS0.75 and RASS1.5 Kev surveys
previously provided.  Those surveys may still be invoked in SkyView using
batch and jar tools but are not accessible on the Web page.
<p>
The seven maps correspond to ranges in the pulse height analysis of the photons
detected.  Since the energy resolution of the PSPC is poor, there is consider
overlap between adjacent bands.

<p>
The energy range for the bands corresponds to:
   <table><tr><th>Band</th><th>Energy range (keV)</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Band 1</td><td>0.11 - 0.284</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Band 2</td><td>0.14 - 0.284</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Band 3</td><td>0.2 - 0.83</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Band 4</td><td>0.44 - 1.01</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Band 5</td><td>0.56 - 1.21</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Band 6</td><td>0.73 - 1.56</td><tr>
   <tr><td>Band 7</td><td>1.05 - 2.04</td><tr>
   </table>
Note the substantial overlap between bands.  Each photon detected is assigned to
a band based on the pulse height analysis for that photon, but the energy resolution
of the detectors is relatively poor.  Also note that Band 3 was not
included in the reference paper due to poor statistics and background modeling.
   
<p>
SkyView has several other sets of surveys derived from ROSAT data
with substantially higher resolution and which include point sources.
The RASS surveys are derived from the RASS all sky survey.  These include count
and intensity maps.  The PSPC maps are dervived from the PSPC pointed observations
which were combined by SkyView.  The HRI survey is derived from a similar mosaicking
of all HRI observations.
