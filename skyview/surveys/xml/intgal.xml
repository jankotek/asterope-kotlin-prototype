  <Description>
   <![CDATA[
This survey combines 9 years of INTEGRAL IBIS observations from December 2002
through January 2011 into a single Galactic Plane image.  A total of 135 megaseconds
of exposure is included in the observations used.  Survey data is generated for
the Galactic plane in the region |b| <= 17.5.  The original flux data has been convolved with
5' seeing kernel.  To minimize loss of resolution in transformations, the Lanczos sampler is
suggested as the default, but may be overriden by the user.
Both the preconvolved and standard
convolved maps are available at the <a href="http://hea.iki.rssi.ru/integral/nine-years-galactic-survey/index.php">Web site</a>.

<p>
The exposure and sensitivity vary considerably over the coverage region, but 90% of the field
has a limiting sensitivity better than 2.2&nbsp;x&nbsp;10<sup>-11</sup>ergs&nbsp;s<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-2</sup>
or about 1.56 mCrab.   Further details of the survey construction are given in the reference.
<p>
The flux and significance maps use the PSF convolved maps from the survey.  The flux maps are in millicrab units.
Exposure maps (with exposures in seconds) were from the exposure extension in the MAPDLD files and
give the dead-time corrected exposure in seconds.
<p>
Links to the exposure and significance maps corresponding to the requested region will
be given in the Web output.  These maps can be generated directly in the CLI interface.
For each waveband the flux, significance and exposure maps are available with just the
end of the survey names distinguishing them (e.g., INT Gal 17-35 [Flux|Sig|Exp] or
INTGal1735[F|S|E])
