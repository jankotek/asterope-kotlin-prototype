  <Description>
   <![CDATA[
2MASS data were collected by uniformly scanning the entire sky in three 
near-infrared bands to detect and characterize point sources brighter than 
about 1 mJy in each band, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 10, 
using a pixel size of 2.0". This achieves an 80,000-fold improvement in 
sensitivity relative to earlier surveys. 

2MASS used two new, highly-automated 1.3-m telescopes, one at Mt. Hopkins, 
AZ, and one at CTIO, Chile. Each telescope is equipped with a three-channel 
camera, each channel consisting of a 256 by 256 array of HgCdTe detectors, 
capable of observing the sky simultaneously at J (1.25 microns), 
H (1.65 microns), and K<sub>s</sub> (2.17 microns).
