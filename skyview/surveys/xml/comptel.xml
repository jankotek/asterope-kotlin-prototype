  <Description>
   <![CDATA[
This survey is a maximum entropy solution to the data taken by the
CompTel instrument on the <i> Compton </i> Gamma Ray Observatory.
The data in this survey are intended only to give the general appearance
of the MeV gamma-ray sky.  Fluxes, flux limits and spectra should be
derived using the Compass system for the analysis of CompTel
data.  Compass is available at the 
<a href="http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/cossc.html"> Compton Observatory
Science Support Center </a>.  
<P>
The maps were originally generated
by the CompTel Instrument Team
as three separate maps in the bands: 
<UL>
  <LI>1-3 MeV 
  <LI>3-10 MeV  
  <LI>10-30 MeV
</ul>
<P>
All CompTel observations from phases 1, 2 and 3 were included in the 
maps (May 1991 through October 1994).
These maps were combined into a single 3-D map at <i> SkyView </i>
