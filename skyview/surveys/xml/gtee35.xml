  <Description>
   <![CDATA[
This survey is a mosaic of data taken at the low frequency T-array near Gauribidanur, India. 
The data was distributed in the NRAO Images from the Radio Sky CD ROM.
<p>
The original 287x101 tiles had only 1 pixel overlap.  To allow
higher order resampling, the data were retiled into two hemisphere
files of 1726x600 pixels with an overlap of 10 pixels.
<p>
The southernmost tiles were only 287x100 pixels.  We assumed
that bottom row of these tiles (as compared with the others)
was truncated.
