  <Description>
   <![CDATA[
   These data were generated at the HEASARC in 1994.  Certain
gaps and streaks in the image have been fixed by interpolating
over the the gap.  Typically these gaps are no more than a pixel
or two wide.  A brief description of the satellite and the
data analysis follows.  The map used in <i> SkyView </i>
is the map designated <tt> 322_15_tot_ecl_samp.img</tt> in the

<a href=ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/heao1/data/a2/maps/heasarc_med_hed> 
HEASARC FTP area</a>.  Many other maps are available.  These differ
in epoch, resolution, energy band,
coordinate system and projection, and sampling methods.
Details are given in the README file in the archive.
<p>
See Allen, Jahoda, and Whitlock (1994) for full details about the
available maps, their processing, and methods for converting the
map intensities into familiar physical units.
