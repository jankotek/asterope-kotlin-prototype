   From the <a href=http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky">WISE mission site:</a>.
   <hr>
   NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mapped the 
   sky at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 micrometers in 2010 with an
   angular resolution of 6.1", 6.4", 6.5" and 12.0" in the four bands.
   WISE achieved a 5 sigma point source sensitivities better and 0.08, 0.11
   1 and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in the four
   bands.  Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser
   coverage and lower zodaical background.  
   <p>
   The WISE All-Sky Release
   includes all data taking during the WISE full cryogenic phase, from January 7, 2010 to August 6, 2010, that were processed
   with improved calibrations and reduction algorithms.  Released data products
   include an atlas of 18,240 match-filtered, calibrated and co-added images sets
   [and additional products not available through SkyView.]
   <hr>
   <p>
   SkyView includes the four WISE bands as separate surveys.  Many non-image
   data products are available at the WISE site.  Note that WISE data is
   distributed in relatively large (&gt;50 MB) image files.  When SkyView generates
   an image for a part of the sky where it has not yet cached the
   data from the IPAC server there may be a delay as full tiles are downloaded
   even when only a small fraction of a tile is needed.  Images
   in cached regions, are generated much faster.  Access to
   the WISE data uses the VO SIA interface maintained at IPAC.  Even when
   data is cached, the SIA service must still be available for successful
   queries.
