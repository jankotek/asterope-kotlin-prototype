How do we setup SkyView as a NetBeans Project?

1. First organize the directory structure in which we are going to save
SkyView content.
    - SkyView
        /Source: Content that is to be compiled before being used in SkyView
                 (currently only /java subdirectory)
           Handling ImageJ:
             Got rid of all ImageJ code except for files that we have editted.
             Will create ImageJ jar with original ImageJ content.  When we create
             SkyView jar we compile using ImageJ jar in class path to satisfy references
             to routines we don't update (we only have about 6 ImageJ Java files).
             Then when we create the SkyView jar we put in the SkyView generated
             ImageJ class files directly and then do an update where we add any
             ImageJ class files from an ImageJ jar but do not replace any class
             files already extent.  So in principle we should be able to switch
             to a new ImageJ easily (in practice we need to worry about whether
             the new version is compatible with the version we used in compiling
             our modified classes).
        /Web:    Content that will go directly into the SkyView web site
                 (HTML, js, operations)
                 Operations content is put here but the directories have
                 .htaccess that ensures the operations tools cannot be
                 accessed through the web.
        /Data:   Content that will not be compiled but is used in creating
                 content for SkyView other than by compilation

2. Deliver into the CM system (we should only do this once) using svn import

If not the first time, then checkout a current version of the system from
   file:///software/jira/svn/skyview

3. Create a New Project (Java with existing sources).  Note that since we
do not use Servlets, this is not a Web project.  When doing this we will need
to add in the source directory .../source/java for the Java code.

4. Edit project properties/Libraries to add needed Jar files:
     FITS (or can use FITS project if available)
     jsamp
     ImageJ
     Junit (for testing -- this is provided by NetBeans so use Add Library rather than
     Add JAR)

5. In Properties/Sources add links to Web and Data directories (if we had non-java code
   we would likely need a link to the non-Java subdirectories of Source).  May look like
   Java packages which isn't optimal but not a big deal.
6. Edit build.xml to add SkyView specific actions (notably adding appropriate content
   to skyview.jar).  Have yet add appropriate 'install' target that copies web content
   and jar to appropriate locations.


Running SkyView from the Jar.

This just requires the SkyView jar which is built as an executable JAR with
with skyview.executive.Imager as the main class.  When the JAR runs, most image
creation requests will download data.  A skycache subdirectory (this can
be controlled by various settings) will be created to cache the downloaded images.
Some surveys do not allow caching.

Creating the SkyView Web site:

To create the SkyView web site we need the content of the Web directory installed.
A copy of the SkyView jar must be places in the cgifile/lib directory

Two directories are currently used to store created files:
